# A Text-Reader Using FaceDistanceMeasure(Depth)
The program makes use of the distance between the user's head and the camera, to adjust the font-size of a displayed text.
This means: _the closer you are from the camera, the smaller the texts' size and vice-versa._

The source code is pretty easy and straight-forward for all those in the computer vision era. 

Several comments for each code-line and explanations were added for better understanding of the code. This is certainly more for the beginners, or those with no experience.
